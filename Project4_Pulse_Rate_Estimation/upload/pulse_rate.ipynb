    "  - ECG is the ground truth.\n",
    "  - More information of the dataset can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6905737)\n",
    "- **Algorithm Description** will include the following:\n",
    "  - how the algorithm works:\n",
    "    - The data first go through a bandpass filter to make our signal in a reasonable range (40-240 bpm) \n",
    "    - The acelerometer data are aggregated in the 3 directions to get a aggregated magnitude \n",
    "    - The signal is divided by 8s windows seprarated by 2 seconds     - The heart rate is estimated \n",
    "    - The movement pulse from the heart beat is filtered out using the accelerometer.\n",
    "  - the specific aspects of the physiology that it takes advantage of:\n",
    "    - Pulse rate is typically estimated by using the PPG sensor. When the ventricles contract, the capilaries in the wrist fill with blood. The (typically green) light emitted by the PPG sensor is absorbed by red blood cells in these capilaries and the photodetector will see the drop in reflected light. When the blood returns to the heart, fewer red blood cells in the wrist absorb the light and the photodetector sees an increase in reflected light. The period of this oscillating waveform is the pulse rate.\n",
    "    - However, the heart beating is not the only phenomenon that modulates the PPG signal. Blood in the wrist is fluid, and arm movement will cause the blood to move correspondingly. During exercise, like walking or running, we see another periodic signal in the PPG due to this arm motion. Therefore we use the accelerometer signal of our wearable device to help us keep track of which periodic signal is caused by motion.\n",
    "  - a describtion of the algorithm outputs: the estimated frequency (in BPM) and the confidence score of that prediction.\n",
    "  - caveats on algorithm outputs: The confidence algorithm sums the frequency magnitude near the pulse rate estimate and divides it by the sum of the entire magnitude. \n",
    "  - common failure modes: When the PPG picks a higher frequency signal that is not from the heart rate: due to hand movements, arm movement, finger movement. \n",
    "- **Algorithm Performance** - The performance was calculated by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the HR estimation and the reference HR from the ECG sensors at 90% availability. We get MAE 8.80 on the train dataset. Note that the data set is from 12 people samples, doing same activities, it may not provide same result on different datasets."
